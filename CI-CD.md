# Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times each day. Each change is verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. 
<br>
 By integrating often, it
 allows teams to detect errors quicker, and locate them more easily. 


**Continuous Deployment** is closely related to CI, and re fers to the release into production of software that passes the CI automated tests. 


## What problems does Continuous Integration / Deployments Solve?
> Essentially, it is the practice of releasing every good build to users <br> Jez Humble of __Continuous Integration__

- Reduce risks 
- Catch bugs quickly 
- Move rapidly to working software 


## Continuous Integration / Deployments in the technology landscape?
- Quality Assurance of Software
	- All new code is tested automatically

**Continuous Integration** The build and testing stages of the software release process
	- Every revision triggeres an automatic build and test

**Continuous Deployment** Code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. 
	- Expands upon CI by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and / or production environment after the build stage.

## [Challenges](https://devops.com/continuous-integration-doesnt-work/) with the technology
- The bigger the team, the more builds get broken
- Priorities (fixing tests or writing more new code?)
- In the end, development teams don't take CI Alerts too seriously. 
- Jenkins / Travis are just fancy tools
